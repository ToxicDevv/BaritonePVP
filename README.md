# BaritonePVP
I do not own Baritone or leijurvs work. I am just showcasing some settings to allow baritone to automatically attack mobs and other players!

Baritone Can be dowloaded at - https://github.com/cabaletta/baritone

The best way to install baritone and replicate the settings shown here for the pvp bot, is to download the Impact Utility Mod. - https://impactclient.net/

Warning to all users - Baritone/Impact is bannable on most servers, I take no responsibilty for you being banned/punished. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The main settings you need enabled for the bot follows,
- Hunt
- KillAura
- Aimbot
- Auto Eat
- AutoWeapon
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To start off, make sure that Hunt, Aura and Aimbot all the have the "Player" setting selected. Make sure "Friends", is disabled.(This is for the whitelist later on) If you would like the bot to track and hunt Hostile/Passive enable The "Passive" or "Hostile" options. The bot will now track all Players and/or mobs it can see. If your on 1.12.2 pvp, lower your APS(Attacks Per Second) to the amount it takes for your weapons critical bar to reload.(Mostly 1.78 APS). 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For your autoeat settings, it's self explanitory. If you want the bot to auto-gapple theres a way to do it but its not 100% perfect. Set your autoeat to eat when your hunger drops half a hunger bar. That way it will eat a gapple every time its on half a hunger bar.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you decide to use autoweapon, baritone will take whaever weapon that is in your hotbar and use it for the sutiable task. This is optional if you want it to only use an axe or something else.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To whitelist other players/friends. Add the player you want whitelisted as a friend, either by doing ".friend add name' or using Middle Click Friend. If you didn't enable the friend option on Aura and Aimbot, baritone will ignore friended players. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you wish to disable the bot at any time, just disable the following.

- Hunt
- KillAura
- Aimbot
