# BaritonePVP
I do not own Baritone or leijurvs work. I am just showcasing some settings to allow baritone to automatically attack mobs and other players!

Baritone Can be dowloaded at - https://github.com/cabaletta/baritone

The best way to install baritone and relipcate the settings shown here for the pvp bot, is to download the Impact Utility Mod. - https://impactclient.net/

Warning to all users - Baritone/Impact is bannable on most servers, I take no responsibilty for you being banned/punished.
